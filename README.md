# RLHF Text Portfolio

Welcome to my **Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) Text Portfolio**.  
This repository showcases my hands-on experience in evaluating AI model outputs using text-based prompts.

---

## Portfolio Overview

- **12 Prompt-Response Examples**  
  Each example includes:
  - Model outputs comparison
  - Logical ranking of responses
  - Clear justification for rankings

- **Evaluation Skills Demonstrated**
  - Following annotation guidelines
  - Writing clear English explanations
  - Comparing multiple model outputs effectively
  - Providing consistent and human-aligned feedback

- **Multimodal Awareness (Theoretical)**
  While my practical experience is text-based, I have a basic understanding of:
  - **Image:** Bounding boxes, OCR concepts
  - **Audio:** Transcription quality checks
  - **Video:** Frame-level event understanding

## How to Use This Repository

1. Review each prompt in the `prompts/` folder (or the PDF file).  
2. See the model outputs and rankings in the `responses/` folder.  
3. Read the justification to understand the evaluation reasoning.

## Notes for Recruiters

- My portfolio is **focused on text RLHF**, which is sufficient for fresher and entry-level AI data roles.  
- I am confident in adapting to multimodal annotation tasks with proper guidelines.
